+ What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a .git folder. That folder is a hidden folder that will contain all the data
related to commits, branches, ... Git stuff that defines the repository.

This task is needed in order to convert a normal directory to a Git repository and be able
to run Git commands in that "folder" (repository).

+ How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What 
value do you think it offers?

Staging area handles all current files that we want to keep in our next commit. Then, in 
the staging area, we put all the files from a working directory that we want to track in
our repository.
In the other hand, the working directory, contains all the files that are in an specific
directory where a repository is located. This does not says that all files in a working
directory are tracked in the repository.
A repository handles all the files from a working directory for wich we want to track 
version control. This allows commiting new changes of files and compare then the different
versions.

By adding items from working directory to staging area, and then commiting these files to
the repository, we ensure that when we clone an specific repository, we copy all the files
(and their versions) that are inside the repository and not all the files in a working 
directory.
