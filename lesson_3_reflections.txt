+ When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you work with other people, it's useful to access the repository on the Internet, so you can access it anytime and anywhere without having to meet your collaborators.
Also, when you work on different computers or different locations, could be useful to have your repository online, so  you can access your projects from anywhere. It could be also usefull to have your repositories online so you have a working copy alway son the Internet to access it and show to someone in any place.
Using a local repository allows you to work on features/bugs that are not currently resolved, without pushing them to public. This allows you to keep your working progress local until you are finished and whant to share it publicly.

+ Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It's useful to pull changes only when you really want to work o see the last changes on the repository. You may be working on an old version of a repository because you are fixin a bug introduced time ago. In that case you don't care about the newer versions of the repository.
Also, if you are working on a branch that does not care about master or other branches, you may not need that branches. In that case is not necessary to keep all the repository up to date. You will ask for that branches when you need it.
I supose that pulling changes in the branch that you are currently working on can break your current code having to merge it. If you don't need that changes at that moment, it's better to ask for them when you need them.
